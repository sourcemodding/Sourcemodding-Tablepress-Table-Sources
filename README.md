## Sourcemodding Table Sources

This repository tracks the contents of each tablepress table over at [sourcemodding](http://www.sourcemodding.com)
It is part of a system that takes user input for each table, lets the admin know, and commits to Github.

Tablepress inturn reads the raw files from Github so that it always has the lastest version of the tables, It polls once every day.

### Contributing

If you want to contribute either do it through the website itself or create a pull request here.
I recommend Ron's editor if you want to work with the raw CSV data.

Be sure to follow the structure of the previously added items in the table otherwise I may reject your input.

Thanks for any help you can provide.
